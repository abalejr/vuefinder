> "The play makes us think about the dizzying variety of possible physical variations to human genitalia and their spiritual and psychological consequences; the usual categories of 'male' and 'female' are just too simplistic."
> --- _Juliet Wittman, [Westword][westword]_

> "Definitely a production worth writing about, talking about, and going to see."
> --- _Berlin Sylvestre, [Out Front][of]_

Lights up.
A bathroom surrounded by emptiness.
Sam is in the bathroom -- alive and alone.
Everyone else in the emptiness, doing their thing.
Jenny and Jolene are dancing together,
Herman doing his nails,
Edward cleaning,
the Narrator watching.
Time can pass slowly outside the bathroom.

> Make-up tutorial number 37:
> creating the perfect brow or, as the kids say,
> keeping your brows on fleek.
> Shit, I don't know if the kids say that anymore.
> Doesn't matter, doesn't matter. Eyebrows.

Staring into the mirror for a few beats...

> ---Sam
>
> Step one.

Touching her brow, then running her finger down her face, moving her nose around, smiling, grimacing, moving eyebrows up, down, in etc.

> ---Sam
>
> Step one… If only there were still a god of eyebrow grooming, we could stop looking in the mirror, sacrifice something small like a squirrel because nobody likes them anyway and enjoy the rest of our day with perfectly shaped eyebrows. But we got rid of those gods, the ones that meddled in every little thing… doing crazy shit. Like there’s this young couple in a pool together — male and female is the idea — and the gods merge them into one being because she asks them to. And then they're sexless. Both sexes. A creature of both sexes. Her, you know, breasts, and probably eyebrows or whatever. His… dangly bits. I don’t know.

Herman enters, looking for a nail file.

> ---Sam
>
> The two of them — the one of them — looks back and curses the pool… asks the gods to curse the pool, which of course they do. So this cursed pool gets a reputation: makes men effeminate or whatever, because clearly it’s the man we’re talking about here. Hermaphroditus, that’s his name. It’s his myth, not hers, and no man wants to get “womaned” out of the blue like that.

Herman scoffs.

> ---Sam
>
> He didn't ask for it, she did! But don't blame her. Don’t blame these poor kids in the middle of some traumatic gender shit, blame the gods laughing at them. Like, come on! Have a little discretion. You're a god. Take it seriously! Now you've got a cursed body of water. Or blessed, really, depending on who you're talking to. Either way, some educated so-and-so comes along like Vitruvius or someone and is all “fuck that” it’s just water. Forget about the gods, we’ve got science now!

She gets out a few pill bottles

> ---Sam
>
> Who needs the gods when there’s all these pretty little pills? Vitruvius didn’t say that, I did. Science starts explaining away the god of this and the god of that… until we're left with just the one: the god of death. That's a tricky one… pills don’t seem to work on that one. But let’s not get hung up on the ending… sometimes that’s the least important part. We’re not talking about death, we’re talking about bodies — and it’s not like we’ve got the world all making-sense now in that arena. It’s not like we can see what’s coming — first this, then that, with logical causes and effects. Things happen. Other things happen. We can't explain it. So, I guess, Step One: accept what your face looks like! Or don't, it's not my problem. On fleek or not, anything might happen. So do what you want! _(pause)_ Come back somewhere between 15 months and never for step two.

She takes a pill.

> ---Sam

> There. See. All gone.

Sam walks out of the bathroom. Time changes.
